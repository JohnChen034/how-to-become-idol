    <h1>How to become an Idol Trainee</h1>
    <p>In order to become an idol, you have to be an idol trainee who has a contract with an agency.</p>
    <p>Therefore, what are the paths to become an idol trainee?</p>

    <h2>1. Street Casting</h2>
    <p>Street casting is literally being cast on the street.</p>
    <p>Each agency has a rookie development team that finds and fosters new talent.</p>
    <p>Casting staff in this rookie development team scouts and casts people on the streets.</p>
    <p>They approach someone to cast them if their appearance matches the image of the idol group they are planning.</p>
    <p>Just because you've been offered a position through street casting doesn't mean you can become an idol trainee right away.</p>
    <p>The contract is written after going through a very basic audition and camera test process.</p>

    <h2>2. Agency Audition</h2>
    <p>Many K-pop agencies conduct various auditions to recruit new talent.</p>
    <p>There can be periodic auditions that agencies announce, ongoing recruitment auditions, and national or global audition tours.</p>
